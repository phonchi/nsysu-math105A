The searching algorithm uses a flag (a variable that can take only `true` or `false` values). When the target is found, the flag is set to `true`: when the target is not found, the flag is set to `false`. When the flag is true the `cur` pointer points to the target value: when the flag is `false`, the `cur` pointer points to a  value larger than the target value. \n","\n","The following shows some different situations. In the first case, the target is 98. This value does not exist in the list and is smaller than any value in the list, so the search algorithm stops while `pre` is null and `cur` points to the first node. The value of the flag is `false` because the value was not found. In the second case, the target is 132, which is the value of the second node. The search algorithm stops while `cur` is pointing to the second node and `pre` is pointing to the first node. The value of the flag is `true` because the target is found. In the third and the fourth cases, the targets are not found so the value of the flag is `false`. \n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jHUrBraEuhm4Ma4Yq1gV3LVXUBKewmKw\"></center>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tpcot6mwzYU-"},"source":["> #### Example 3: The following shows a simplified algorithm for the search.

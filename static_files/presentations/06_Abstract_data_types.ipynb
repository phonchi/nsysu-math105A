The cities are vertices and the undirected edges are the roads that connect them. If we want to show the distances between the cities, we can use weighted graphs, in which each edge has a weight that represent the distance between two cities connected by that edge. Another application of graphs is in computer networks (Chapter 6). The vertices can represent the nodes or hubs; the edges can represent the route. Each edge can have a weight that defines the cost of reaching from one hub to the adjacent hub. A router can use graph algorithms to find the shortest path between itself and the final destination of a packet.

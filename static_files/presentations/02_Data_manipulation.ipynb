A single `Python` statement might map to a single machine instruction, or to many tens or even hundreds of machine instructions, depending on the complexity of the statement and the efficiency of the machine language. Different implementations of the `Python` language interpreter, in concert with other elements of the computer's operating system software, take care of this mapping process for each particular computer processor. As a result, the `Python` programmer does not need to know whether she is executing her `Python` script on a RISC processor or a CISC processor.\n","\n","We can recognize many `Python` operations that correspond closely to \n","the basic machine instructions for modern computers or our hypotehetical computer. Addition of `Python` integers and floating point numbers clearly resembles the `ADDI` and `ADDF` op-codes of our simple machine. \n","Assigning values to variables surely involves the `LOAD`, `STORE`, and `MOVE` op-codes in some arrangement. `Python` shields us from worrying about which \n","processor registers are in use, but leverages the op-codes of the machine to \n","carry out our instructions. **We cannot see the instruction register, program \n","counter, or memory cell addresses, but the `Python` script executes sequentially, one statement after the other, in the same way as the simple machine language programs.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Boolean expressions"],"metadata":{"id":"WjPuxQq1sA-3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false.
